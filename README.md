# Coffee Shop Project

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Project, a comprehensive exercise designed to reinforce our web development skills while creating a digital presence for a new local coffee shop. This project focused on HTML, CSS, and responsive web design, and was critical in reinforcing both fundamental and advanced web development concepts.

## Project Overview

The Coffee Shop Project was divided into two sprints.  The website consists of a Landing Page and a Menu Page, each designed to engage visitors and provide detailed information about the coffee shop's offerings.

### Key Features
### Comprehensive Multi-Page Website Development
- **Interactive Landing Page**: Engages visitors with a visually appealing introduction to the coffee shop, complete with a navigation bar, hero section, and call-to-action buttons.
- **Detailed Menu Page**: Offers a structured and informative menu, listing the coffee shop's offerings like hot drinks, cold drinks, and pastries, categorized for easy navigation.

### Semantic HTML5 Markup
- **Structured Content**: Utilizes semantic HTML tags to structure the website content, ensuring both readability by humans and understandability by search engines.
- **Accessibility**: Implements best practices to make the website accessible to as wide an audience as possible, including screen readers.

### Advanced CSS Styling
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website is fully responsive and functional on devices of all sizes, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- **Modern CSS Features**: Leverages advanced CSS techniques like Flexbox for layout management, and custom properties for efficient styling.

### Interactive User Experience
- **Dynamic Interactions**: Incorporates interactive elements such as buttons and links that provide a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **CSS Animations**: Enhances visual appeal and user engagement with subtle animations, transitions, and micro-interactions.

### Modular and Scalable Codebase
- **Sass Implementation**: Utilizes Sass (SCSS) to write more maintainable, modular CSS code, allowing for easier updates and scalability.
- **Component-Based Design**: Encourages reuse of styles and elements, promoting a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach to CSS coding.

### Robust Development Practices
- **Code Quality**: Adheres to best coding practices, ensuring clean, well-commented, and well-structured code for easy maintenance and future updates.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensures that the website provides a consistent experience across various web browsers and devices.
